## Explain Updated Neme 💗
The name DoBee combines "Do" (suggesting action and productivity) with "Bee" (symbolizing industriousness and efficiency, like a busy bee). It evokes an image of a hardworking, efficient tool that helps users get things done quickly and effectively.(UI UX Designer Idea 💡).
